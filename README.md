# Predicting-Insurance-Premiums
Predicting the Insurance Premiums from the Machine Learning Models. 
Understanding the problem and then proceeding with the data set
I have trained various regression models for predicting the Insurance premiums.
I have done a good Exploratory data analysis and Visulaization on the features of the Data which gives more insight to understand the data.
The Regression models which were trained and validated in this dataset are Linear Regression,Multiple Linear Regression,Polynomial Linear Regression,DecisionTree Regressor,RandomForest Regressor,Support Vector Machines Regressor.
Evaluating and comparing all the model to find out the Best Regressor model which are predicting the Insurance Premiums acccurately as Trained.
I have also used to test the best Regressor model with the New data( the datapoints of me) TO PREDICT the Insrance to be paid by me as per my data and the model trained on the particular data.
This Helps the Insurance Company with the data of the customers asking the relevant customers to pay the different premium according to the data.
